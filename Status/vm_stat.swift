        (1) Call the kernel API
        (2) Read the API's message
     
        The catch: In order to ultimately display API message, need host_statistics64;
        however, host_statistics64 requires an out-value of integer_t, which
        vm_statistics64 isn't.  So we fashion a pointer of type integer_t along the way.
 
        N.B.: After a good deal of work, finally found the relevant documentation.
              See: https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/gnumach-doc/index.html
